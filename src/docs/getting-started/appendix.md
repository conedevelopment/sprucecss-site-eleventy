<p class="lead">In the appendix, you can find some references that inspired or gave any input related to any aspects of Spruce CSS or our learning in general.</p>

Creating a framework is a complex task; you need a lot of input. You usually don't invent the wheel; you use the old ideas in a new form. You try to sum up your knowledge in an acceptable format.

Learning modern CSS can be rewarding. So here are a lot of good resources if you want to know more about the concept and techniques that might include in Spruce.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - It is the most popular CSS framework. The case is that BS is almost the ultimate truth regarding excellent solutions. Reading its documentation and source code is a good learning exercise.
- [Layout patterns](https://web.dev/patterns/layout/) - A good source of modern layout examples. Spruce CSS doesn’t use a grid system, and we don’t plan to implement one. We use Flexbox, Grid, and some predefined mixin helpers.
- [Learn Responsive Design](https://web.dev/learn/design/) - A great resource for modern responsive development. We loved the “Internationalization” section.
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) - An excellent course on layouts. Create responsive designs with fewer (or without) `@media` breakpoints. Although Spruce uses breakpoint, we try to reduce their uses as possible.
- [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev/) - Minimal snippets for modern CSS layouts and components. A comprehensive collection of fantastic CSS solutions.
- [Form Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/form-design-patterns/) - Forms mean the interaction on any webpage or application. Making them suitable is crucial. Learn more from one of the best books on this topic.
- [Modern CSS Solutions](https://moderncss.dev/) - An excellent list of modern CSS solutions.
- [Accessibility for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) - A light introduction about accessibility.
- [Defensive CSS](https://defensivecss.dev/) - Practical CSS and design tips that helps in building future-proof user interfaces.
