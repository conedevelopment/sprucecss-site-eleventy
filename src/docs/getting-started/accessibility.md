<p class="lead">Inclusivity and accessibility (A11Y) are some of the main concerns of Spruce CSS. We aim to help you develop more accessible web-based projects through our code and documentation, where we will try to show you small, related tips and guidance where necessary.</p>

Building something more inclusive is a long process. We learn on the way, too, so this always will be a work in progress.

{% notification %}We will do our best to test our code with <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/download/">NVDA</a> (under Windows 10). Testing is an area where help is much appreciated. <a href="https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/issues">Please open an issue</a> if you have any input related to this topic. Thank you!{% endnotification %}

## WCAG 2.1

Our primary reference is the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) level AA. As a CSS framework, Spruce canâ€™t tackle too much of this reference, but it is more critical at [Spruce UI](/ui/getting-started/introduction), where you can grab standalone components.

## Integrated Inclusivity

We will meet the following accessibility-related issues:

- The base colors and combinations will complete the color contrast guides.
- We respect the user settings through `prefers-reduced-motion` and `prefers-color-scheme`.
- We care about semantics and will present the code examples more meaningfully.
