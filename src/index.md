        title: "Who is Spruce CSS for?"
        description: "<p>Spruce CSS is small and tries not to be in your way. It gives you a solid foundation and utilities, but the only included components are forms (which you can opt out of).</p> <p>It is for you if you like to handle your CSS/SCSS in separate files and write your code. It uses just a few helper classes; most <a href='/ui/getting-started/introduction/'>components</a> are drop-ins.</p>"

        title: "It is Modern and Lightweight"
        description: "<p>By modern, we mean it uses new CSS stuff sometimes at the expense of backward compatibility. Fortunately, nowadays, the new CSS features are released in bulk across different vendors.</p> <p>With modern CSS, you can solve more with less code. It is around 1400 lines and weights a little, and you can choose what things you want to use to make it even smaller.</p>"

        title: "Dark Mode and RTL Support"
        description: "<p>Using modern CSS to handle a dark theme or support a different writing direction (RTL) is more manageable. If you use Spruce CSS the intended way, you will be okay with a new theme or RTL support.</p> <p>Everything on this <a href='/docs/getting-started/introduction/'>documentation</a> page or under the <a href='/ui/getting-started/introduction/'>components</a> supports them with just a little code.</p>"

        title: "It Is Built on Sass"
        description: "<p>Sass can help a lot when writing a CSS framework or using one. You can use Spruce as a standalone CSS file, too, but to maximalize its potential, we suggest Sass. <a href='/blog/the-simplest-sass-compile-setup/'>For a simple compile setup</a>, check out our related blog post.</p>"
