<p class="lead">A centered post layout with overflown media elements.</p>

## Technical Details

- We use the `:is` selector to include the elements in the selection for the narrower column.
- Using the `aspect-ratio` we make the iframes responsive.
- Controlling the vertical space is a bit tricky when it comes to various media elements and text, so we've added some exceptions.
