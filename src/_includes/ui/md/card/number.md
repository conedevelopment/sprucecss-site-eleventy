<p class="lead">A JavaScript-based count-up number card where you can easily highlight your or your company's accomplishments.</p>

## Technical Details

- Our count-up number card utilizes straightforward JavaScript code that includes an observer. This observer detects when the items are in the viewport.
- Modify the `duration` in the JS file to configure the animation duration.
- The `.l-number` is a simple layout; feel free to remove it if you have a custom solution.
