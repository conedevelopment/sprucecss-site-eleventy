<p class="lead">An accordion (or collapsible) card component can be helpful if you want to display more information in a smaller area. Using it, you can hide anything other than the title and show the rest on demand.</p>

## Technical Details

- It uses a button element and the `aria-expanded` attribute to control its state and to make it more accessible.
- We only show a focus ring on `:focus-visible` and just on the SVG icon.

## Resources

- [Collapsible Sections](https://inclusive-components.design/collapsible-sections/) - It is based on this.
