<p class="lead">A generic alert component with different type variation and close option.'</p>

## Variations

- **--danger**: by default, it gets red accents.
- **--info**: by default, it gets blue accents.
- **--success**: by default, it gets green accents.
- **--warning**: by default, it gets yellow accents.

## Technical Details

- You should use the ARIA `alert` role on your alert elements to convey more meaning.
- If you need a closing functionality for the UI, you can use the `.alert__close` element, but you need to implement the closing functionality yourself.
