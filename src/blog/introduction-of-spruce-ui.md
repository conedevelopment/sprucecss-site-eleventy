<p class="lead">We just released the first version of <a href="/ui/getting-started/introduction">Spruce UI</a>, a collection set of reusable, copy-pastable HTML, CSS components (with some JS) built on Spruce CSS.</p>

This project aims to give you (and us) a collection of components to serve some quality components with our framework.

The size of the elements is on a broad spectrum. There are some tiny components, but there are complete pages too.

It is a modular UI library, so one of the base intentions is to combine them easily. Achieving this is sometimes harder, sometimes easier.

## How to Use Them

Copy-paste them into your project, and modify them as you wish. Feel free to customize them as you need.
